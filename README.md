## My Favorite Thing I Have Written

Hi, my name is Raul! This is my second year here at Laurier Brantford in my first year of UX Design minoring in BTM! A favorite speech that I wrote would have to be for my 18th birthday that my parents organized for me. My family and I are from Romania and when you turn 18, it's a big day! 

This speech that I wrote was well delivered and it was my favorite thing that I ever wrote because I expressed my thankfulness and love for my parents in front of at least 80 people! This was no easy task.
